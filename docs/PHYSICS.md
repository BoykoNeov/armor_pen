# Physics Notes

Public, textbook-level physics backbone for the simulation. Everything here is
**representative and illustrative** — order-of-magnitude, not spec-sheet (see
CLAUDE.md §10). The bar is *plausible*, not *validated*.

## 1. Method: MLS-MPM

**Moving Least Squares Material Point Method.** Particles carry mass, momentum,
and deformation state; a background Eulerian grid handles stress divergence and
self-contact each step. Chosen over SPH because:

- The grid gives **automatic self-contact** — the penetrator and the armor
  collide simply by sharing the grid; no explicit contact model.
- It **avoids SPH's tensile instability**, which would otherwise wreck exactly
  the spall/fracture behavior we care about.

We **grow the canonical 88-line MLS-MPM** reference (Hu et al.) rather than
rewriting from scratch: add plasticity, then damage, then the multi-material
armor stack, validating visually at each step via `tools/inspect_cache.py`.

SPH may return later, specifically for HEAT-jet fluid-like erosion.

### Transfer cycle (per substep)

1. **P2G** — scatter particle mass/momentum (and APIC/MLS affine term) to grid.
2. **Grid update** — apply forces (stress divergence), gravity if any, boundary
   conditions; convert momentum to velocity.
3. **G2P** — gather updated velocity (and velocity gradient) back to particles.
4. **Particle update** — advect positions; update deformation gradient `F`;
   apply the constitutive model (§3).

## 2. Unit system — mm · ms · g

**Work in one consistent, non-dimensionalized system. Never mix raw SI into the
kernels** (raw SI makes stiffness huge and `dt` tiny, inviting float error).

The chosen system is **millimetre – millisecond – gram**, well established for
impact/ballistics. Derived units fall out cleanly:

| Quantity | Unit in this system | Note |
|---|---|---|
| length | mm | |
| time | ms | |
| mass | g | |
| velocity | mm/ms = **m/s** | 1500 ≈ a 1.5 km/s impact |
| density | g/mm³ | steel ρ ≈ **7.85e-3** |
| stress / pressure | g/(mm·ms²) = **MPa** | steel E ≈ **2e5** MPa |
| force | g·mm/ms² = **N** | |

Reference values (steel): ρ ≈ 7.85e-3, E ≈ 2e5 MPa, a 1.5 km/s impact ≈ 1500.

All physical constants live **once**, in these units, in
`solver/src/ballistics_solver/materials.py`. The manifest's `units` field
records the choice (`"mm-ms-g"`).

## 3. Material model

Elasticity + rate-independent plasticity + a damage threshold:

- **Elasticity:** fixed-corotated or Neo-Hookean hyperelasticity on the
  deformation gradient `F`.
- **Plasticity (metals):** **von Mises** plastic return-mapping — project the
  trial stress back onto the yield surface each step, storing plastic
  deformation. This is what lets the metal flow and mushroom rather than shatter.
  *Implemented (milestone 2):* a perfectly-plastic (no hardening) **radial
  return in log-strain (Hencky) space** — SVD `F = U Σ Vᵀ` per particle after
  G2P, radially return the deviatoric log-strain onto `‖dev τ‖ = √(2/3)·σ_Y`,
  reconstruct `F`. Plastic flow is isochoric (volumetric log-strain untouched).
  Two plausibility notes (root §1): the `√(2/3)` and the deviatoric split use a
  2D two-principal-strain convention, not exact 3D J2; and because the reported
  stress is fixed-corotated Cauchy von Mises (the momentum-driving stress), it
  reads *approximately* capped near yield — with a small over-read tail at
  extreme volumetric compression at the shock front, since fixed-corotated has
  no equation of state (`λ(J−1)J → 0` as `J → 0`). This is a pre-existing
  property of the elastic model, best tamed viewer-side by a percentile clamp.
- **Damage:** a scalar in `[0, 1]` (latched, irreversible). When a particle
  fails it **detaches** into a free fragment — `_p2g` drops its stress term so it
  keeps mass + momentum but can no longer hold tension/shear. This is the spall
  spray. The particle is *flagged*, never created or destroyed (fixed particle
  count, see CACHE_FORMAT §5). Two failure modes, selected per material:
  - **Ductile (metals)** *— implemented, milestone 3:* accumulated equivalent
    plastic strain `alpha` crossing the material's `damage_threshold`. Metals
    flow and mushroom, then spall along the plastic channel walls / crater lip.
  - **Brittle (ceramics)** *— implemented, milestone 4:* a **stress** trigger,
    independent of plastic strain — brittle solids have no plastic reserve, so
    they shatter the instant the stress state reaches their strength surface.
    A brittle particle latches damage when the fixed-corotated Cauchy **von Mises
    stress ≥ `yield_strength`** (compressive comminution directly under the
    penetrator) **or** the **max tensile principal stress ≥ 0.1·`yield_strength`**
    (mode-I tensile cracking at free surfaces — back-face spall, interface
    debonding at impedance mismatches, the fracture conoid ahead of the rod).
    Note the von Mises branch is evaluated *after* the radial return has already
    capped deviatoric stress at yield, so in practice it fires for **any brittle
    particle that yielded at all** — the model is "brittle = shatters where a
    metal would instead have flowed," not a separate higher fracture stress above
    yield. The tensile branch is the independent one, catching low-stress cracking
    the deviatoric criterion misses.
    `yield_strength` doubles as the fracture strength (no separate field); the
    0.1 tensile ratio is illustrative (ceramics crack in tension at a small
    fraction of their compressive strength). This is what makes a ceramic core
    *shatter* into rubble and read visually distinct from a denting steel plate,
    instead of behaving as a near-indestructible ductile wall at KE velocities.

### Material archetypes (illustrative)

| Material | Character |
|---|---|
| Tungsten / DU rod | Very dense, stiff, high yield — the KE penetrator. |
| RHA (steel) | Baseline ductile armor; mushrooms and spalls. |
| Ceramic / composite | Higher stiffness, **brittle** (`brittle: true`) — fails on the stress trigger above, shattering with ~zero plastic flow. |
| ERA filler | An impulse layer that degrades the penetrator on contact. *(reactive impulse — future milestone; the material constants exist but the reactive mechanism is not wired yet.)* |

## 4. Timestep & why we bake offline

The cost driver is the **CFL timestep, not particle count**. Steel's sound
speed is ~5 km/s; explicit MPM requires

```
dt  <  C_cfl · Δx / c_sound
```

which in SI lands `dt` on the order of **1e-8 – 1e-7 s**. A penetration event is
a ~microseconds physical window, so it is a **short window of thousands of cheap
substeps**. That is precisely why the solver is offline, on the GPU, and dumps
only every Nth substep as a render frame.

**Stability gotcha:** if the sim blows up, suspect `dt` (vs. sound speed × grid
spacing) *before* touching the material model. A sim that explodes or does
nothing is often a **units** mistake, not a physics bug.
